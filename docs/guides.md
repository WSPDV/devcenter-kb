# Guides

We provide guides to assist you in understanding every aspect of integrating your application with the Mekari API using the HMAC Authentication protocol. There will also be final code that you can use in your codebase to speed up integration development. However, keep in mind that the final code is not a software development kit (SDK) and may not function in your current situation or environment.

The code in the guide will be written in the vanilla version of each programming language, which will need to be modified if you want to integrate the code into your application codebase. If you find an error in the guide or something isn't working properly, please let us know, and it would be fantastic if you could contribute to the Mekari open source community by submitting a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mekari-engineering/devcenter-kb) to fix the problem.
